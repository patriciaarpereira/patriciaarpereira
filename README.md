Hello everyone! I'm PatrÃ­cia ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m **currently learning** SQL, Python and Power BI in my **Data Analysis** postgraduation in ISLA (2024/2025) and in DataCamp. 
- ðŸŒ± I am **also learning a little bit** about NoSQL, data architecture, cybersecurity and statistics.
- ðŸ“˜ **In the following months**, my postgraduation will also explore R and Machine Learning in R and Python. I will also explore these fields in DataCamp.

- ðŸ”­ I will present some **projects** in this repository regarding the different fields I have interest. At this moment: 
  - ðŸ”› **SQL**:
      - Files: "SQL Aviation Database 20250118 - Create database (final version).sql" and "SQL Aviation Database 20250120 - Exercises (final version).sql"
      - This is a simple aviation database with information about some airports, airplanes and their models and about the flights.
        This work was developed for Tecnologia de Base de Dados in PG ANALYTICS & DATA SCIENCE EMPRESARIAL 2024/2025 with translation.
      - Topics:
      	- WHERE AND ORDER BY
      	- GROUP BY AND HAVING
      	- JOIN
      	- SUBQUERIES
      	- CTE
      	- WINDOW FUNCTIONS
      	- CASE WHEN.
  - ðŸ”› **Python**:
      - Files: "Blackjack_lists_20250114_finalversion.py" and "Blackjack_numpy_20250114_finalversion.py".
      - This work about Blackjack game was developed for Algoritmia e ProgramaÃ§Ã£o em Python in PG ANALYTICS & DATA SCIENCE EMPRESARIAL 2024/2025.
      - I developed two files to try to understand the difference between list and array (although I am aware I have still a lot to learn).
  - ðŸ”› **Power BI**:
      - File: "Bl
      - This dashboard was developed for 2 Fundamentos de Business Intelligence e AnÃ¡lise de Dados in PG ANALYTICS & DATA SCIENCE EMPRESARIAL 2024/2025.
      - The database is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/loan-eligible-dataset/data.
      - In the following months, I will present a new project with improvements mainly exploring DAX.

  - ðŸ”œ **Machine Learning in R**
  - ðŸ”œ **Machine Learning in Python**
      
- ðŸ’¬ And **what about me?** I am PatrÃ­cia and I am 33 years old. I am from Braga, Portugal. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Management and a masterâ€™s degree in Finance. I worked in the financial market and in the bank transfer areas. I published a paper regarding ESG. In the meantime, I turned out to be partner of a dog hotel. It allowed me to grow in business and made a dream come true. However, my work there is done, and I would like to work again in a company. I noticed the importance of data in my previous jobs and this is the reason why I am attending a postgraduate program and learning in DataCamp.

- ðŸ’¼ I am **looking for a job** as Data Analyst/ Scientist in Europe.
